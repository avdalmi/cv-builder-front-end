# CV-Builder

As a project for a new start-up secondment company, together with another developer we built a CV-builder. My colleague and I split the responsibilities, where I was in charge of front-end developement and he was in charge of back-end developement.

The front-end was built using React, Formik, Yup validations, Axios, and Material UI. The back-end utilises MongoDB, Overleaf to produce LaTeX files.

The goal of this project was to provide a standardized CV format that the company could use to send to clients. By utilizing Formik and Yup validation, I was able to create a user-friendly form that ensured all necessary information was collected and entered correctly. Axios was used to grab and display country data from countryAPI. Material UI was used to create a visually appealing and intuitive user interface.

With this CV-builder, the secondment company can now quickly and efficiently generate a standardized CV that accurately reflects the skills and qualifications of their employees.
